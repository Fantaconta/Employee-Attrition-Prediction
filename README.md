# Employee Attrition Prediction

## Project Overview

**Global Talent Solutions (GTS)** is a multinational company specializing in talent acquisition, employee training, and workforce analytics. As part of their mission to empower businesses through innovative HR solutions, this project aims to **predict employee attrition** using machine learning techniques and data-driven strategies.

Employee attrition is both costly and disruptive. This project helps GTS address this issue by delivering actionable insights that:

* **Reduce costs** related to frequent hiring and onboarding
* **Improve workforce stability** by retaining top talent
* **Enhance client satisfaction** through service continuity
* **Support strategic HR decisions** with predictive analytics

## Objectives

* Understand key drivers of attrition in GTS's workforce
* Build predictive models to classify employees as **“Likely to Leave”** or **“Likely to Stay”**
* Provide the HR team with interpretable and data-backed insights to enhance retention strategies

## Workflow Breakdown

### 1. Data Understanding

* Explore employee dataset for patterns, anomalies, and attrition trends
* Identify potential predictors like job role, satisfaction level, performance rating, etc.

### 2. Data Preparation

* Handle missing values, duplicates, and outliers
* Encode categorical variables and scale numeric features

### 3. Model Development

* Train and evaluate multiple classification models
* Use cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning to improve performance
* Compare models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC

## Technologies Used

* Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
* Jupyter Notebook
* Machine Learning Algorithms (Random Forest, XGBoost, Logistic Regression)



## Key Takeaways

* Data-driven approaches can meaningfully reduce attrition rates
* Tree-based models like Random Forest and XGBoost performed best in predicting employee exits
* Work-life balance, job role, and satisfaction levels were among the top factors influencing attrition
